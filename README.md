The beautiful ***Remake*** of [React-Beauty Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ImpendingDoom.react-beauty-theme "React-Beauty \"The First\" on Marketplace")

I thought, that it would be a great idea to make a nice, well-shaped, open-sourced 
and, finally, [React][1]-oriented theme, for all my fellow comrades, who use [React][1], including me!

I really hope this theme will help you in your development struggles!

Feel free to make pull requests, post issues! I'm open to suggestions!

## Currently supported languages

---
- Javascript
- JSX
- ...and more to go!

> `P.S.: This theme probably won't go well with other languages. If you want support for some language, just post me an issue on GitHub`
