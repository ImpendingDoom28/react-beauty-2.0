The beautiful ***Remake*** of [React-Beauty Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ImpendingDoom.react-beauty-theme "React-Beauty \"The First\" on Marketplace")

<p data-align="center">I decided to make a nice, well-shaped, open-sourced 
and, finally,</p>
<p data-align="center"> React-based theme, for all my fellow comrades, who use React!</p>

<p data-align="center">I really hope this theme will help you in your development struggles!</p>

<p data-align="center">Feel free to make pull requests, post issues! I'm open to suggestions!</p>

<p id="diff-lng">P.S.: This theme probably won't go well with other languages. If you want support for some language, just post me an issue on GitHub</p>

## ***Enjoy!***
