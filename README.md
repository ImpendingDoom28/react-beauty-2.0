The beautiful ***Remake*** of [React-Beauty Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ImpendingDoom.react-beauty-theme "React-Beauty \"The First\" on Marketplace")

I thought, that it would be a great idea to make a nice, well-shaped, open-sourced 
and, finally, [React][1]-oriented theme, for all my fellow comrades, who use [React][1], including me!

I really hope this theme will help you in your development struggles!

Feel free to make pull requests, post issues! I'm open to suggestions!
